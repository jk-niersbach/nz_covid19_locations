**This project has been discontinued given that Locations of Interest are no longer being updated.**


### Current content

NZ Covid19 Location of Interest checker to provide additional searching and sorting.
By default displays New locations first, followed by recent updates.

Built with [DataTables.js](https://datatables.net).

Planned updates:
- auto-updating when source data is updated
- improve appearance
- move history to a row below, rather than an inline cell - will have to dynamically create and delete the row
